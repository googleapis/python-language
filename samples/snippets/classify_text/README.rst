Google Cloud Natural Language API Python Samples
===============================================================================

This directory contains samples for Google Cloud Natural Language API. The `Google Cloud Natural Language API`_ provides natural language understanding technologies to developers.

This tutorial demostrates how to use the `classify_text` method to classify content category of text files, and use the result to compare texts by their similarity to each other.  See the `tutorial page`_ for details about this sample.

Setup
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Authentication
++++++++++++++

Authentication is typically done through `Application Default Credentials`_,
which means you do not have to change the code to authenticate as long as
your environment has credentials. You have a few options for setting up
authentication:

#. When running locally, use the `Google Cloud SDK`_

    .. code-block:: bash

        gcloud auth application-default login


#. When running on App Engine or Compute Engine, credentials are already
   set-up. However, you may need to configure your Compute Engine instance
   with `additional scopes`_.

#. You can create a `Service Account key file`_. This file can be used to
   authenticate to Google Cloud Platform services from any environment. To use
   the file, set the ``GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`` environment variable to
   the path to the key file, for example:

    .. code-block:: bash

        export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/service_account.json

.. _Application Default Credentials: https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication#getting_credentials_for_server-centric_flow
.. _additional scopes: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/authentication#using
.. _Service Account key file: https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2ServiceAccount#creatinganaccount

Install Dependencies
++++++++++++++++++++

#. Install `pip`_ and `virtualenv`_ if you do not already have them.

#. Create a virtualenv. Samples are compatible with Python 2.7 and 3.4+.

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ virtualenv env
        $ source env/bin/activate

#. Install the dependencies needed to run the samples.

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ pip install -r requirements.txt

.. _pip: https://pip.pypa.io/
.. _virtualenv: https://virtualenv.pypa.io/

Classify Text Tutorial
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++



To run this sample:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python classify_text_tutorial.py

    usage: classify_text_tutorial.py [-h]
                                     {classify,index,query,query-category} ...
    
    Using the classify_text method to cluster texts.
    
    positional arguments:
      {classify,index,query,query-category}
        classify            Classify the input text into categories.
        index               Classify each text file in a directory and write the
                            results to the index_file.
        query               Find the indexed files that are the most similar to
                            the query text.
        query-category      Find the indexed files that are the most similar to
                            the query label. The list of all available labels:

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
